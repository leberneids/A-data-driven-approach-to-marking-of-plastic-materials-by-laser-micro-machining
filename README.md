# A data-driven approach to marking of plastic materials by laser micro-machining

Laser marking is a fast and flexible process technology and more environmentally friendly, contrast and durability are also improved. The aim of this project is to study three different lasers, a Femtosecond laser (DTU), a UV Laser (Coloplast) and a Fiber Laser (Masentia) and to establish a guideline that process engineers, material specialists and product developers can use for the development of products at Coloplast. With these three lasers we will have to identify which type of laser gives better result with a specific type of plastic (Still to define clearly from external supplier) and how Coloplast can implement these processes into their products and industrial settings. 

In the scope of this master's thesis project, an investigation into the optimization of the laser marking process will be conducted through a comprehensive data-driven approach. The primary aim is to discern the most favorable parameters for enhancing the laser marking process, with a specific emphasis on practical applications relevant to Coloplast.

The research will leverage Design of Experiments (DOE), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and machine learning techniques. DOE will be instrumental in systematically planning and conducting experiments to gather relevant data on the laser marking process. ANOVA will then be employed to analyze the collected data, providing statistical insights into the significance of various factors and their interactions.

Furthermore, machine learning methods will play a pivotal role in extracting patterns and relationships from the on-field data obtained through real experiments. This holistic approach ensures that the analysis is tailored to the specific nuances of the process, the equipment involved, and the operating conditions prevalent at Coloplast. By combining these methodologies, the research aims to yield insights that are directly applicable to the practical context of the company's laser marking operations.
